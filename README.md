# Data_Analysis_Automation_Pipeline Using Python & AI

This repository contains two fully automated data-analysis pipelines designed to streamline exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, feature engineering, and summary reporting for any structured dataset.

These pipelines were built after completing my foundational training in traditional data analysis, and now I am extending those skills by integrating AI-powered automation to significantly reduce manual effort and improve analytical efficiency.
