# Data_Analysis_Automation_Pipeline Using Python & AI

This repository contains automated data-analysis pipelines designed to streamline ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) & exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, feature engineering, and summary reporting for any structured dataset.

These pipelines were built after completing my foundational training (thoertical and Job stimulation training) in traditional data analysis, and now I am extending those skills by integrating AI-powered automation to significantly reduce manual effort and improve analytical efficiency.
